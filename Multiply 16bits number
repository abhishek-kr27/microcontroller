FLOWCHART : 

Start the program

Using two different registers, load the MSBs of the data.

Using two different registers, load the LSBs of the data.

As a result, successive multiplications are performed.

As a result of the registers being filled out, a product was obtained.

In the registers, you can find the output of the program.

End the program

MOV A,R0 ; Move the data of R0 in Accumulator 

MOV B,R2 ; Move the data of R2 in B

MUL AB ; Multiply A and B the output also store in A and B ( eg . 12*34 = 03AB so A gets AB and B gets 03 be consider as a Carry ) 

MOV 33H,A ;  Output of A store at location 33H

MOV R4,B ;  Output of B (Carry )  store at R4

MOV A,R1 ; Move the data of R1 in Accumulator
